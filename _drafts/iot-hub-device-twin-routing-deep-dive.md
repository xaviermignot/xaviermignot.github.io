Azure IoT Hub message routing is a great feature that let you send messages to different endpoints based on rules, directly in the IoT Hub service. It's mostly used for routing telemetry messages, but can also send other kind of events, such as lifecyle or Device Twin events.  

The first time I used it for Device Twin change events, I could not find answers to the following questions:  
- Does it trigger an event for change on any section of the twin (reported, desired and tags) ?
- What is the content of the events payloads ?
- Is the condition on a route executed before or after the change ?

In this post I will do a deep dive into IoT Hub message routing on Device Twin change events to answer these questions.  
I am using az cli from bash prompt in WSL throughout this article, you can also use the Azure portal or Powershell cmdlets if you will.

## Creating the demo environment

### Configuring the IoT Hub
For this demo we will need an IoT Hub in the Free or Standard tier, we can't use the Basic tier as it does not support the Device Twin feature.  
Once the IoT Hub is created, in the *Message routing* pane we add a route to the built-in endpoint with data source set to *Device Twin Change Events*, like this in the portal:
![Route creation in portal]({{ page.img_dir}}/01-route-portal.png){: width="600" }  
Or with the following command in az cli:
```console
$ hub_name="<ENTER-HUB-NAME>"
$ az iot hub route create --hub-name $hub_name -n route-device-twin-changes --source twinchangeevents --endpoint-name events
```
It's a pretty simple setup: no custom endoint, no routing query (for the moment), a single route to send all twin changes to the same endpoint already present at the creation of the IoT Hub.  

### Creating a sample device
We need a device, so we create one with Sas authentication as it's always simpler to use for demos (we also store its connection string in a variable for later use): 
```console
$ hub_name="<ENTER-HUB-NAME>"
$ device_id="<ENTER-DEVICE-ID>"
$ az iot hub device-identity create --hub-name $hub_name -d $device_id
$ device_connection_string=$(az iot hub device-identity show-connection-string --hub-name $hub_name -d $device_id -o tsv)
```
To send device twin change events we will need two things:
1. For reported property changes, we must simulate the device so I have prepared a simple .NET console app available [here](https://github.com/xaviermignot/device-twin-routing-demo){: target="_blank" }. From the project folder, we run the following commands to store the device connection string and run the tool to initialize reported properties:
```console
$ dotnet user-secrets set "DeviceConnectionString" $device_connection_string
$ dotnet run
DeviceClient created ! Getting current twin...
First time with this device, let's initialize it !
Done ! Exiting now...
```
The first run of the tool creates two reported properties:
- `propertyUsedOnlyOnce` which will never be used again ðŸ˜”
- `color` set to `Red`, next runs of the tool will change it to `Blue`, then back to `Red`, and so on...
2. For desired property and tag changes, we can use az cli with the `az iot hub device-twin update` command. Let's do this a first time to finish the initialization of the device:
```console
$ az iot hub device-twin update --hub-name $hub_name -d $device_id --set tags='{"tagProperty":"tagValue"}'
$   
```

Set-up is done, later to monitor the events flowing to the IoT Hub we will also use az cli with the `az iot hub monitor-events` command.

The following diagrams sums up the whole set-up:

## Testing changes on properties (desired/reported) and tags

For each test I am using Windows Terminal with two panes open in WSL: one on the lef to make the twin change, one on the right to monitor the changes:
![Reported test in Windows Terminal]({{ page.img_dir }}/03-test-reported.png)

### Test on reported properties
As seen in the image above, runing the device tool in the left pane changes the `color` reported property from `Red` to `Blue`. In the right pane, we see an event with the following payload:
```json
{
    "version": 10,
    "properties": {
        "reported": {
            "color": "Blue",
            "$metadata": {
                "$lastUpdated": "2021-02-13T17:56:23.2704925Z",
                "color": {
                    "$lastUpdated": "2021-02-13T17:56:23.2704925Z"
                }
            },
            "$version": 7
        }
    }
}
```
As a comparison, here is the whole reported section of the device twin:
```json
"reported": {
    "propertyUsedOnlyOnce": "This is set only once",
    "color": "Blue",
    "$metadata": {
        "$lastUpdated": "2021-02-13T17:56:23.2704925Z",
        "propertyUsedOnlyOnce": {
            "$lastUpdated": "2021-02-13T16:07:58.6609507Z"
        },
        "color": {
            "$lastUpdated": "2021-02-13T17:56:23.2704925Z"
        }
    },
    "$version": 7
}
```
To summarize, in the event payload we have:
- The `version` of the whole device twin
- The new values of the properties included in the change
- The `$metadata` of the properties in the change
- The `$version` of the reported property section
And we don't have:
- The reported properties not included in the change (and their `$metadata`)
- Any data from the other section of the device twin (tags, desired)

### Test on desired properties
Back in my Windows Terminal, on the left pane I enter the following command to add a new property in the desired section:
```console
az iot hub device-twin update --hub-name $hub_name -d $device_id --set properties.desired.desiredColor='Orange'
```
In the right pane I receive an event with the following payload:
```json
{
    "version": 11,
    "tags": {
        "tagProperty": "tagValue"
    },
    "properties": {
        "desired": {
            "desiredProperty": "desiredValue",
            "desiredColor": "Orange",
            "$metadata": {
                "$lastUpdated": "2021-02-14T18:05:38.5825801Z",
                "$lastUpdatedVersion": 3,
                "desiredProperty": {
                    "$lastUpdated": "2021-02-14T18:05:38.5825801Z",
                    "$lastUpdatedVersion": 3
                },
                "desiredColor": {
                    "$lastUpdated": "2021-02-14T18:05:38.5825801Z",
                    "$lastUpdatedVersion": 3
                }
            },
            "$version": 3
        }
    }
}
```
So we have more content in this payload:
- The `version` of the whole device twin
- The tags section
- The whole desired properties section (not only the one that has changed), with the full `$metadata` and the `$version`
Only the reported section missing !

### Test on tags
Let's do the same test but by adding a new property in the tags sections with the following command:
```console
az iot hub device-twin update --hub-name $hub_name -d $device_id --set tags.newTagProperty='newTagValue'
```
It generates an event with the following payload:
```json
{
    "version": 12,
    "tags": {
        "tagProperty": "tagValue",
        "newTagProperty": "newTagValue"
    },
    "properties": {
        "desired": {
            "desiredProperty": "desiredValue",
            "desiredColor": "Orange",
            "$metadata": {
                "$lastUpdated": "2021-02-14T19:53:14.4410421Z",
                "$lastUpdatedVersion": 4,
                "desiredProperty": {
                    "$lastUpdated": "2021-02-14T19:53:14.4410421Z",
                    "$lastUpdatedVersion": 4
                },
                "desiredColor": {
                    "$lastUpdated": "2021-02-14T19:53:14.4410421Z",
                    "$lastUpdatedVersion": 4
                }
            },
            "$version": 4
        }
    }
}
```
Basically we have the same event as for updating the desired properties: all the tags and all the desired properties with the `$metadata`.


## Adding a condition on the route

Now that we know that an event is triggered for each section of the twin, and what's in the payload, we can move to the third question: if we add a condition on the route, will this condition be evaluated before or after the change ?  
Let's update the route to figure this out:
```console
az iot hub route update --hub-name $hub_name -n route-device-twin-changes --condition '$twin.properties.reported.color = "Red"
'
```
With this condition, now only events from device with reported color set to *Red* will be sent to the endpoint.  
Using the dotnet tool again to simulate the device, whose reported color is *Blue*, the input says that the reported color has turned to *Red*:
```console
$ dotnet run
DeviceClient created ! Getting current twin...
Changing 'color' reported property from 'Blue' to 'Red'...
Done ! Exiting now...
```
In the monitoring pane, there is an event flowing:
```json
{
    "version": 13,
    "properties": {
        "reported": {
            "color": "Red",
            "$metadata": {
                "$lastUpdated": "2021-02-14T22:50:11.6725239Z",
                "color": {
                    "$lastUpdated": "2021-02-14T22:50:11.6725239Z"
                }
            },
            "$version": 8
        }
    }
}
```
Running the dotnet tool again, the reported color turns back to *Blue*:
```console
$ dotnet run
DeviceClient created ! Getting current twin...
Changing 'color' reported property from 'Red' to 'Blue'...
Done ! Exiting now...
```
In the monitoring pane, no event is flowing.  
So the answer is clear: first the change is made on the device twin, then the routing condition is evaluated, on the updated version of the device twin.


## Summary

The following table shows the answers to the two first questions from the begining of this post:

Updated twin section | Payload of event
-------------------- | ---------------
Reported property    | Part of the reported section updated
Desired property     | All the tags and desired properties
Tags                 | All the tags and desired properties
