title: Why I care about Azure certifications (and why I think you should too)
tags: azure

Recently I have seen and participated in conversations about the utility of IT certifications, especially Azure certifications. As I have passed several of them I am convinced of their utility, and I will use this post to expose my point of view.


## My personal journey with certifications

I have started my career in 2004 and earned my first certification in 2016, so I wasn't into certifications at the beginning. I knew some certified people, some of them were arrogant, personally I did not feel the need to be certified on a technology I was already using daily (whether is was C#, ASP.NET or WCF).  
And I did not want to do some work outside of work hours, I had other plans in my early adult life (üéâüçªüôåüé∏), and then different plans in my less-early adult life (üë´üë∂üë∂ but still üé∏).

In 2016 I started working with Azure, and after a few months I though I had a good understanding of the platform, as my project was using several PaaS services.  
At that time it felt more relevant to get certified, especially on Azure. For me it was a way to broader my knowledge of the platform, for my employer a requirement for the gold partnership with Microsoft. And I was given some time and some training material from my employer and from Microsoft, so finally why not.  
Over the course of a year and a half I passed the Azure Developer (I'm a dev first), the Azure Administrator (I wanted to improve my knowledge on infrastructure), and the Azure Architect exams. 

In 2019 when Microsoft introduced the role-based certifications, and came up with transition exams for those like me with *old* certifications, I couldn't help to renew all of mine.  

Then in 2020 the IoT Developer specialty was open to beta, as an Azure IoT fan I was waiting for it so I sat for the exam in beta, and a few month later it felt logical for me to pass the DevOps Engineer as well. 

And finally during the pandemic I passed two Fundamentals certifications, first one on AI (I had a voucher to use, and very little knowledge on AI), second on Power Platform (I was curious to try this, and was suggested a training with a voucher at the end). I will tell more about Fundamental exams at the end of this post.

So that's my story with Azure certifications, from 0 to 10 exams in less that 5 years, and a complete change of mind about getting certified. So let me explain why I take these exams.

## Why I take exams
Exam is the cherry on the cake, learning, studying and getting knowledge is more important


## What earning a certification means...
Certifications are theory exams, event if there are labs now. 
Getting certified show the world that you have spent some time on the subject, so at least you know what you are talking about.

## ... and what earning a certification doesn't mean
Still on the theory thing, the certifications you have doesn't tell anything about the quality of the work you will do using the related technology. But your experience and technical abilities will, and these are much harder to measure with a number.
