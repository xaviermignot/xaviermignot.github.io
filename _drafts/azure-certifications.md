title: Why I care about Azure certifications (and why I think you should too)

Recently I have seen and participated in conversations about the utility of IT certifications, especially Azure certifications. As I have passed several of them I am convinced of their utility, and I will use this post to expose my point of view.


## My personal journey with certifications

I have started my career in 2004 and earned my first certification in 2016. So I haven't been a fan of certifications forever, for 12 years I wasn't into it for various reasons.  
First I had some colleagues who passed them with an instructor-led course, and a significant part of the course was to work on the questions of a dump. The goal seemed more to be prepared for an exam than to learn something new or to improve existing skills.  
Secondly at that I did not want to dedicate time to my work outside of work hours. Even if my employer offered the exam fee (but not the instructor-led course), I would have to work during evening and week-ends to be prepared. I was not considering doing that in my early adult life for some reasons (🎉🍻🙌🎸) and even a few years later for other reasons (👫👶👶).  
Lastly I did not see the value of being certified at that time (especially on things like WCF...), I just felt I did not need it to make good work and my employer did not push me to do it either so everyone was happy.  

In 2016 I started working with Azure (after a company change), and after a few months on the project I had a good overall understanding of the platform. My employer of that time, a relatively small Microsoft *pure player* partner, needed a few certified people in the staff to become Gold Partner.
