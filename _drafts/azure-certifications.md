title: Why I care about Azure certifications (and why I think you should too)
tags: azure

Recently I have seen and participated in conversations about the utility of IT certifications, especially Azure certifications. As I have passed several of them I am convinced of their utility, and I will use this post to expose my point of view.


## My personal journey with certifications

I have started my career in 2004 and earned my first certification in 2016, so I wasn't into certifications at the beginning. I knew some certified people, some of them were arrogant, personally I did not feel the need to be certified on a technology I was already using daily (whether is was C#, ASP.NET or WCF).  
And I did not want to do some work outside of work hours, I had other plans in my early adult life (üéâüçªüôåüé∏), and then different plans in my less-early adult life (üë´üë∂üë∂ but still üé∏).

In 2016 I started working with Azure, and after a few months I though I had a good understanding of the platform, as my project was using several PaaS services.  
At that time it felt more relevant to get certified, especially on Azure. For me it was a way to broader my knowledge of the platform, for my employer a requirement for the gold partnership with Microsoft. And I was given some time and some training material from my employer and from Microsoft, so finally why not.  
Over the course of a year and a half I passed the Azure Developer (I'm a dev first), the Azure Administrator (I wanted to improve my knowledge on infrastructure), and the Azure Architect exams. 

In 2019 when Microsoft introduced the role-based certifications, and came up with transition exams for those like me with *old* certifications, I couldn't help to renew all of mine.  

Then in 2020 the IoT Developer specialty was open to beta, as an Azure IoT fan I was waiting for it so I sat for the exam in beta, and a few month later it felt logical for me to pass the DevOps Engineer as well. 

And finally during the pandemic I passed two Fundamentals certifications, first one on AI (I had a voucher to use, and very little knowledge on AI), second on Power Platform (I was curious to try this, and was suggested a training with a voucher at the end). I will tell more about Fundamental exams at the end of this post.

I do not always succeed at exams, I have already failed twice (for the Architect exams they're the toughest), but I have always analyzed my weaknesses, fixed them and pass on second attempt. I have also had various scores, sometimes I have passed just above the 700 limit üò¨, other times I have killed it and scored above 900 üòé.  

So that's my story with Azure certifications, from 0 to 10 exams in less that 5 years, and a complete change of mind about getting certified. So let me explain why I take these exams.


## Why I take exams

The main reason for me to take an exam is not the exam itself, it's all the things I will learn while studying. The exam is just the cherry on the cake, it is important as it sets an objective to reach and it helps to stay motivated, but what really matter at the end is the knowledge gain.  

And I have always learned something while preparing an exam, even when I was already proficient on the subject:
- Azure Developer: I already knew Web Apps, Storage Account and most common services, but I learned about Traffic Manager, Azure AD, VMs, Service Fabric...
- Azure Administrator: as a developer it was an opportunity to refresh my knowledge about networking, learning about security, NSGs, and more Azure AD (that bloody Azure AD that frightens developers üòÖ)
- Azure Architect: lots of things regarding site recovery, backups, cloud-hybrid scenarios, SLAs, ...
- Azure IoT: I already knew IoT Hub pretty well, but was not aware of Device Configuration, customizing DPS with an Azure Function, and I had tons of things to learn on IoT Edge because I don't use it in my daily work

But to be honest it always feels great to earn a certification, at this point I think I'm kinda addicted to the feeling of excitement when I click on the button to reveal the exam result üòú. I enjoy also sharing by badges, as all MCP I guess.  
It's also a boost for my career, as I get more messages on Linkedin, but once again it's not the main reason for me, I do it for me, to improve my skills.


## What being certified means, and doesn't mean

Certifications are theory exams, event if there are labs now in some of them. 
Getting certified show the world that you have spent some time on the subject, so at least you know what you are talking about. But it doesn't necessarily mean that you have all what it takes to do a good job on the related technology, it depends more on your technical abilities and your experience. And these much harder to measure with a number.

So if I work with someone that is certified, I don't think at first *"Hey, this person must be the best to do XXX"*, I think *"Hey, this person has spend some time studying XXX, he/she might be very interested about it"*. I won't make a difference between certified and non-certified people at work, for instance most of my coworkers in my are not certified, and they're the best for the job of course it doesn't matter.

In my case, today I am certified as an Azure developer and architect, and that's what I am: I can design and implement using Azure services, make me work on an Azure-based backend, I'll do a good work for sure. Need some help with an Azure IoT based solution ? I can do that also, I am certified on this but more important it's what I do on a daily basis my friend. Same story with Azure DevOps, yup I am a certified DevOps engineer (we all know it means nothing), the important thing is my experience with Azure DevOps as a tool.    
But I am also certified as an Azure administrator. Does it mean that I *am* an Azure administrator ? No, I have just dedicated some time to study it, I might have more theoretical knowledge about it than other, but will not be the best fit to manage your infrastructure.
