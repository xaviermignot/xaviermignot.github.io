A I really enjoy making architecture diagrams using Visio, I want to share in a few posts some tips to help you do the same.  
This post is the second of this series, the [previous one]({% post_url 2021-03-21-visio-tips-tools %}) introduced the basic tools of Visio to manipulate the shapes. 
This one is about other tools that will help you to better position your shapes, and have nice perfect straight lines between them.


## Why I never use PowerPoint for architecture diagrams

As an introduction to shape alignment, here is one thing that bugs me in PowerPoint that make unusable to me for architecture diagrams. In the GIF below I simply select one shape then another, and use the *Align middle* feature to align them on the same horizontal line:  
![Align middle in PowerPoint]({{ page.img_dir }}/ppt-align.gif)  
The behavior I expect when doing this is to use the first selected shape as a *reference*, so that only the second selected shape will move to align with the first one. And you see what PowerPoint does ? It creates a new *reference* by merging the position of both shapes ðŸ˜±  

On the other side Visio keeps the position of the first selected shape:  
![Align middle in Visio]({{ page.img_dir }}/visio-align.gif)  
Which seems like a detail but it makes me happy, as it' much easier to control the position of the shapes like this, especially when working with more than 2 shapes.

## Meet the Align tool

## Meet the Position tool

## Don't be afraid of the ShapeSheet
