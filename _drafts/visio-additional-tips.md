This post closes the *Microsoft Visio 101* series after an [introduction to the tools]({% post_url 2021-03-21-visio-tips-tools %}), and a focus on [positioning and aligning shapes]({% post_url 2021-03-28-visio-tips-align-shapes %}).  
For this one I don't have a specific topic, but I have remaining tips to share ðŸ˜Š


## Find your own style

## Use the text background feature

## Create temporary groups

## Sync you favorite shapes using git
