Following my [previous post]({% post_url 2022-03-18-tls-terraform-azure-self-signed %}) on generating self-signed certificates with Terraform, this one is the second post of the series.  
This time we are going to use Let's Encrypt as the certificate authority (CA) instead of our own machine. As a result we will get trusted certificates that can be used in production, for free.

## Level 2: requesting a certificate from Let's Encrypt

If you don't know what Let's Encrypt is, in a few words it's a free, automated and open certificate authority (CA), allowing everyone to get certificates trusted by browsers at no charge.  
As the Let's Encrypt certificates are valid for 90 days (instead of 1 or years for commercial authorities), automation is strongly recommended.
