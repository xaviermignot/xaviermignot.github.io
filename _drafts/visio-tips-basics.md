A I really enjoy making architecture diagrams using Visio, I want to share in a few posts some tips to help you do the same.  
This one is about the basics, Visio is a complex software so it's important to know basic stuff and feel overwhelmed.


## Know the Visio "tools"

To get started you should get comfortable with the *tools* of Visio, which are:
- The pointer tool, to select and drag shapes
- The text tool, to associate text to shapes
- The connector tool, to draw lines between shapes
- The connection point tool, to edit the connection points of a shape  

All the tools are located in the `Home` tab of the ribbon, in the `Tools` toolbar:
![Tools toolbar]({{ page.img_dir }}/01-tools-toolbar.png)  
It's important to know their respective roles, and how to switch between them, it's quite simple you will see ðŸ¤—  

### The pointer tool
The pointer tool is the most basic, selected by default. You can use it to select, drag, copy shapes for instance.  
Let's start by creating a rectangle in a blank diagram by clicking on the white rectangle in the toolbar:
![Create rectangle]({{ page.img_dir }}/02-draw-rectangle.png)  
*(This is another tool I didn't mentioned, you can use to draw basic shapes it's pretty straightforward ðŸ˜‰)*  
Now you're in the *rectangle creation mode*, so any click & drag in the diagram zone will draw a rectangle. If you want to stop drawing them and start moving them for instance, select the pointer tool again using the `Ctrl+1` shortcut (or clicking on the pointer in the toolbar but memorizing the shortcut is worth it).  
Then you'll be able to move around those rectangles, resize them, delete, any basic action you can expect from a diagram drawing tool.  
That's all the pointer tool is about: getting back to the most basic mode of the tool, using the shortcut to memorize: `Ctrl+1`  
Let's keep a single rectangle before moving to the second tool.
