title: Hello world !
---

Thank you for visiting, this is my very first blog post ever, I am 38 so I guess it's never too late ! We will see where this goes, I intend to write about technology, Azure, IoT, sharing my experience outside of the group of people I am directly working with.

### Let's introduce myself !

My name is Xavier Mignot, I am a french software developer living close to Bordeaux. I have been working with Microsoft technology for more than 10 years, as a .NET developer first and as an Azure architect now.  
You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_xavierm){:target="_blank"} and on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mignotxavier/){:target="_blank"}, let's connect !
